This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving loose equality (==) and its potential to produce unexpected results. The `bug.js` file contains code that uses loose equality to check for null or undefined values, which can lead to inaccurate comparisons.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that utilizes strict equality (===) for accurate null and undefined checks. This example highlights the importance of using strict equality when comparing values in JavaScript, especially when dealing with numbers, to ensure precise and reliable results.
